# sportstracker

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This Project was my first major Github project where i used the API to do GET request.
I was challenges doing a successful GEt request. But soon found a solution.
I spent a lot of time correcting the UI, and tried to get a good UX.

A few resources that i revered:
-Udemy
-[Git hub prject](https://github.com/beraldofilippo/volleystats)
-youtube

#vedio tutorial to my sports App
-[drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IZobb4NNP1z1LtmDSjVZuYItAX1hNKIW/view?usp=sharing)

Learned a lot of stuffs. Had a very good experience!
