# sportstracker

My final version of the SportsTeacler App.<br>
Currently this app keeps track of 2 sports<br>
Formula1 and NBA


## Getting Started

This Project was my first major Flutter project where in i used the REST API to obtain required data.
I was intially struggling in doing a successful GET request. But soon found a solution.<br>
I spent a lot of time correcting the UI, and tried to get a good UX.
